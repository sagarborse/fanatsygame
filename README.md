Simulation of IPL Fantasy League game:

You should have a list of players. Each player will have a price associated with him and a characteristic like Batsman/Bowler/All-rounder/WicketKeeper. 

When a user logs in, he gets to create his fantasy team. He gets to choose his team composition and a team name. He is given an arbitrary amount of 100 million dollars to create his team.

He can choose players from the list and make his team. You need to ensure he makes his team within the allocated money and also is not violating the team composition (for e.g.: if his composition is 4 batsmen, 3 all-rounders, 1 wicketkeeper, 3 bowlers then he should not be allowed to select more than 4 batsmen).

You are expected to create a good design/architecture for the classes you will need. Good object Oriented design is expected. We will also need a very basic 1 page UI. Assume that the user is logged in. The UI should provide the functionality to select the team-name, composition, select players and create his team. Also, you need not have fancy images for the players and stuff. Show the team in the form of a list instead.

You can refer to the link given above for more understanding. Once you log in on the given link, you click on the “Manage Team” Tab and you will be able to see what exactly you need to implement.

For this task, you can create a list of 20-30 players for the user to choose from. Also, a team should consist of 8 players instead of 11 to make things simpler. You should permit the following team compositions:

3 batsmen, 1 wicketkeeper, 2 all rounders, 2 bowlers
3 ba tsmen, 1 wicketkeeper, 1 all rounders, 3 bowlers
4 batsmen, 1 wicketkeeper, 1 all rounders, 2 bowlers
